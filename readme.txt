Select different Themes for one or more, or all WordPress Pages, Posts or other non-Admin pages.  Or Site Home.

== Description ==

Allows the Administrator to specify which Theme will be used on specific Pages, Posts, other non-Admin pages (such as Category or Archive pages) or Site Home.  Also allows a Theme to be specified for All Pages or All Posts. In turn, even when a Theme is specified for All Pages or All Posts, a different Theme can still be specified for specific Pages or Posts.

Think what you could do if you could easily use more than one Theme on your WordPress web site or blog:

* Divide your site into Sections, each with its own unique look
* Style individual Pages, Posts, or other elements (Site Home, Category main page, Archive main page) with a different Theme
* Select a unique Theme for all Pages, Posts, Attachments, Category pages or Archive pages
* Make slight variations to a Theme, using Child Themes, for one or more Pages, Posts or other elements (Site Home, Category main page, Archive main page)
* Supports Multiple Stylesheets for Accessibility and other purposes (create one Child Theme for each Stylesheet)
* Test a new Theme on one or more Pages or Posts
* Convert to a new Theme a Page or Post at a time
* Host multiple mini-web sites on your WordPress site, each with a different Theme
* When a larger version of an image attachment is displayed, for example, when clicking on a gallery image thumbnail, use a different theme to display it, for one or all images attached to a Page or Post

**Use with other Plugins**:  **BuddyPress** and Theme Test Drive plugins must both be Deactivated when jonradio Multiple Themes is Activated

**Changing Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Background, Header, etc.)?**:  See the FAQ (Frequently-Asked Questions) tab for important information on changing Options on Themes other than the Current Theme.

To select all Pages, Posts, Archives, Categories, etc. that begin with the same partial URL, a "Prefix URL" can be specified by selecting the Prefix checkbox when creating an entry on the Settings page for the Plugin.  Restriction:  the Prefix URL cannot contain all or part of a Query, which is the portion of a URL that begins with a question mark ("?").  Although the Prefix cannot contain a Query, URLs containing a Query will be matched by the Prefix.

If a Theme is not specified for a Page, Post, Site Home or other WordPress-displayed web page, such as Category or Archive display, the **Current Theme** specified in **Appearance-Themes** on the Admin panels will be used.

When selecting a Theme for Site Home or all or specific Pages, Posts or other non-Admin pages, the Theme must be shown in the list of Available Themes on the Appearance-Themes Admin panel. If necessary, install the Theme.  In a WordPress Network (AKA Multisite), Themes must be **Network Enabled** before they will appear as Available Themes on individual sites' Appearance-Themes panel.

I hesitate to use the term **Theme Switcher** to describe this plugin, because the term has so many meanings.  This plugin does **not** alter the standard WordPress options that define what Theme is used on your WordPress site.  Instead, it dynamically (and selectively) overrides that choice.  Technical details aside, what this means is that deactivating or deleting the plugin will instantly revert to the WordPress Current Theme that you have defined through the standard WordPress Appearance-Themes Admin panel.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Use "Add Plugin" within the WordPress Admin panel to download and install this plugin from the WordPress.org plugin repository (preferred method).  Or download and unzip this plugin, then upload the `/jonradio-multiple-themes/` directory to your WordPress web site's `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.  If you have a WordPress Network ("Multisite"), you can either Network Activate this plugin, or Activate it individually on the sites where you wish to use it.  Activating on individual sites within a Network avoids some of the confusion created by WordPress' hiding of Network Activated plugins on the Plugin menu of individual sites.
1. Be sure that all Themes you plan to use have been installed and are listed under Available Themes on the WordPress Appearance-Themes Admin panel. In a WordPress Network (AKA Multisite), Themes must be **Network Enabled** before they will appear as Available Themes on individual sites' Appearance-Themes panel.
1. Select Themes to be used on the Plugin's "Multiple Themes plugin" page in the WordPress Admin panels, which is found in both the **Appearance** and **Settings** sections.  You can also get to this page by clicking on the **Settings** link for this plugin on the **Installed Plugins** page.
1. If you need to change Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Background, Header, etc.) for any Theme other than the Current Theme, see the FAQ (Frequently-Asked Questions) tab for important information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the Theme Options (Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Background, Header, etc.) used for each Theme? =

For the Current Theme, nothing changes when using this Plugin.  Options for the Current Theme, including Widgets, Sidebars, Menus, Background, Header and other Customizations supported by the Theme, can be modified in the Admin panel using the Appearance menu items on the left sidebar and the Customize link displayed beside the Current Theme on the Manage Themes tab of Appearance-Themes.

It is more difficult to modify Options for Active Themes that are *not* the Current Theme.  We hope to build this functionality into this plugin in a future Version, but it is not clear just how practical that is, so the best that can be said is:  Maybe.

For now, there are two approaches.  Except for Widgets, the first approach is the most likely to give you success.  Menus, on the other hand, really work well with the first approach, and are severely restricted with the second method.

**WARNING**:  So far, we have not received any reports of, nor have we tested, using both Method #1 and #2 on the same WordPress site.  Use Caution if you plan to do so, as we cannot predict the results. 

**Method #1:**

Set the Theme Options with Live Preview.

Note:  Widgets cannot be placed using this Method.

1. Go to Appearance-Themes-Live Preview in the Admin panels.
1. Use the right sidebar to modify the Theme Options.  Note that "Navigation" will not appear until a Custom Menu has been defined in Appearance-Menus.  Navigation-Primary Navigation is where you would set the custom menu to be used for the Theme you are currently previewing.
1. Click the Save & Activate button.
1. Go immediately to Appearance-Themes to reactivate the Current Theme.

**Method #2:**

Use the Theme Test Drive plugin.

Note:  this approach only allows Menus to be set for one Theme.  Using this method to assign one or more menus to a Theme will unassign menus for all other Themes.

The jonradio Multiple Themes plugin (i.e. - this plugin) must be Deactivated, and the Theme Test Drive plugin installed and activated, so that each Theme can be selected with the Theme Test Drive plugin, allowing the Theme's Options to be set "as if" it were the Current Theme.

1. Deactivate jonradio Multiple Themes 
1. Install the Theme Test Drive plugin found at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-test-drive/
1. Activate the Theme Test Drive plugin
1. Go to Appearance-Theme Test Drive 
1. In the Usage section, select an alternate Theme you will be using with jonradio Multiple Themes 
1. Push the Enable Theme Drive button at the bottom 
1. Go to the WordPress Admin panel's Appearance menu (left sidebar) 
1. Make your changes to the Theme Options, including Widgets, Sidebars, Menus (see note above about Menus), Background, Header and other Customizations for this alternate Theme (which will appear as if it were the Current Theme)
1. If you have more than one alternate Theme with Options you wish to change, repeat Steps 4-8 for each alternate Theme 
1. Deactivate the Theme Test Drive plugin 
1. Activate jonradio Multiple Themes
1. Changes to the Options for the Current Theme can now be made normally, just as you would without either plugin
1. Both the alternate and Current Themes should now display all Theme options properly when selected through the jonradio Multiple Themes plugin

= What happens when I change Permalinks? =

For entries you have created for individual Pages and Posts with this plugin, you can subsequently change your Permalink structure or you can change the Permalink of a Page or Post, without having to change the plugin's entry.  However, for other pages, such as Categories or Archives, you will have to delete your old entries and create new ones with this plugin.

= I added a new entry but why doesn't it appear in the list of entries? =

If you add an entry that already exists, it merely replaces the previous entry.

= How can I change the Theme for an entry? =

Simply add the entry again, with the new Theme.  It will replace the previous entry.
